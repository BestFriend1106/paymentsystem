1. Define the endpoints/routes: Identify what endpoints your application needs to have. You have already defined some endpoints -  /api/invoice ,  /api/invoice/<int:invoiceId> . 
   Add more endpoints if required. 
 
2. Define the database schema: Define the schema for your database tables. You have already defined the  Invoice  table. Add more tables if required. 
 
3. Implement CRUD operations: For each endpoint, implement the corresponding Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. You have already implemented the Read and Create operations for  /api/invoice , and the Read and Update operations for  /api/invoice/<int:invoiceId> .  
 
4. Test the endpoints: Test all the endpoints to make sure they work as expected. Use tools such as Postman or curl to test the endpoints. 
 
5. Handle errors: Implement error handling for the endpoints. This includes handling errors related to database operations, invalid input, etc.  
 
6. Add authentication and authorization: If required, implement authentication and authorization for the endpoints. This can be done using Flask's authentication libraries or third-party libraries. 
 
7. Optimize performance: Optimize the application's performance by adding caching, load balancing, and other performance-related optimizations. 
 
8. Document the API: Document the API using tools such as Swagger, to make it easy for developers to use the API.
